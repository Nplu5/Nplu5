### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am a research scientist coming from a electrical engineering background and discovered my love for development along my studies. I currently work with several technologies like .NET (ASP.NET, Xamarin, Azure), React as well as some Java-Backend Development. Besides that I am just getting into NLP with Python programming. 

Besides that I try to write regularly a on my blog which can be found on [skrause.me](https://blog.skrause.me/).
